The Project FlickerPhotos is designed to search and download photos from the FlickerAPI.
It follows the MVVM model where "PhotosViewModel" forms the main ViewModel class. It contains "PhotoScrollViewController"- the controller to load the view for the images, the searchbar and the loading indicator[when scrolled up to get data till i exhausts[ like inifinite data download ]].
Notification mechanism is used to let the controller know that the image is downloaded.

- contains 3 table  views for 3 scrollable columns
- contains search bar to search image
- when user scrolls all the way to bottom , the query is launched again to download more images for the current searched text
